title: In the Beginning, There Is Science
description: How we discover the way the world works.

The scientific method is a way of learning about the world through observation, experimentation, and sharing information.

When we think of science, we may think about the subjects we studied in school — biology, chemistry, physics.
Some of us, depending on our experiences, might even feel a bit of anxiety thinking about those classes.
But many of us tend to think of science as a categorization of topics, or as something studied and practiced by people trained to be specialists — something outside the reach and understanding of most people.

The reality is that we are all born as natural scientists.
As we develop and grow from babies, we explore our world.
We hold a ball, let it loose from our grasp, and notice that it falls rather than rises.
It does this over and over without fail.
When it hits the ground, it bounces, then falls again — bounce, fall, bounce, fall — with each bounce diminishing until it stops.
A crumpled piece of paper doesn’t bounce.
A flat sheet of paper floats.
We observe these things, wonder, and delight in the observation.
We play and observe.
We watch others play.

As we observe the behaviors of the physical world, we build up an observational library of responses in our minds.
We learn how things tend to work.
We may not think of it in these terms, but we’re collecting data and testing it against variances in that data.
We let go of a ball and it *rises*.
We gasp.
It’s a balloon filled with helium, and it’s soon lost to sight.
New data, new experience.

We hold a glass and drop it.
It shatters.
An adult gasps and maybe admonishes.
We learn that experiments have costs.
We begin to learn, unfortunately, that independent scientific research can be discouraged — and later, when organized into structured, chronological learning, it can become rote and boring.
But at the beginning, practicing science is natural and exhilarating.
