title: The Scientific Method Is Organized Play
description: The way children learn through play is a model for understanding the scientific method.

Chemistry. Biology. Physics.

Through traditional schooling, categorized learning has organized the body of scientific knowledge into these and other familiar subjects.
But people often forget that they learned science in a much more instinctive and unstructured way long before they began school.

As developing toddlers, children are natural scientists, exploring their world.
They experiment, dropping things and observing that balls bounce while crumpled paper does not, flat sheets of paper float, and glasses break.

As children grow, they watch and learn from each other and from adults.
They combine their understanding of falling objects with their experience of applying force when throwing balls.
While they may instinctively feel they need to add loft to give distance to their throw, they are building on a fundamental understanding of the relationship between forces and motion.
In a sense, they are building an internal library of data — a stored body of remembered sensations and experiences that they draw on for future actions.
They observe others and learn from their techniques.

This is considered a natural part of human development.
It is based on essential elements of humanity, including imagination, curiosity, and creativity.
The human brain is wired to experiment and collect data from the earliest age.
In childhood, this activity is considered play.

These instinctive behaviors — thought, experiment or action, observation, repetition — are the foundations of science.
Human development is core to science, the art of science woven into human awareness.
Its principles — autonomy, freedom, improvement, revelation, sharing, imagination, creativity — are hidden in plain sight in daily living, most evident in children.
But these human principles, loosely coupled in the natural discovery of play, can be drawn out into a formal system for thinking about the universe and the way it works.

This formal system has a name: **the scientific method**.

The scientific method is a way for us to ponder the rules that govern the universe, test those theories, gather evidence of how well those theories work, and refine them as we learn along the way.
Much like play, the scientific method is meant to capture human creativity and imagination, but it provides a framework more formal than play.

1. **Imagine**  
   Become curious and wonder *“What if…?”* or *“Why does that happen?”*

2. **Predict**  
   Make a guess about what might happen — like setting rules for a game.

3. **Try It Out**  
   Experiment by testing the idea in action.

4. **Watch Closely**  
   Observe what actually happens during the experiment.

5. **Compare**  
   Ask whether the results matched the prediction.

6. **Adjust the Idea**  
   Revise the idea based on what was learned, and try again if needed.

7. **Share the Discovery**  
   Tell others what was found so they can learn from it too.

The scientific method provides a way to keep track of ideas, measure results, and ensure that experiments can be reproduced and shared.
But behind the structure of the scientific method lies the underlying human imagination, creativity, and joy that began in early childhood.

*Science is organized play*.
