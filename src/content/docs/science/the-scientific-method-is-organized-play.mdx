title: The Scientific Method Is Organized Play
description: How we discover the way the world works.

Science brings to mind the topics of chemistry, biology, or physics.
Through traditional schooling, categorized learning has organized the body of scientific knowledge into these familiar subjects.
But people often forget that they learned science in a much more instinctive way long before they began school.

As developing toddlers, children are natural scientists, exploring their world.
They experiment.
They drop things and observe that balls bounce.
Crumpled paper does not.
A flat sheet of paper floats.
Balls roll when pushed and eventually stop.
Glasses break when dropped.

As children grow, they watch and learn from each other and from adults.
They combine their understanding of falling objects with their experience of applying force when throwing balls.
While they may instinctively feel they need to add loft to give distance to their throw, they are building on a fundamental understanding of the relationship between forces and motion.
In a sense, they are building an internal library of data — a stored body of remembered sensations and experiences that they draw on for future actions.
They observe others and learn from their techniques.

This is considered a natural part of human development.
It is based on essential elements of humanity, including imagination, curiosity, and creativity.
The human brain is wired to experiment and collect data from the earliest age.
In childhood, this activity is considered to be play.

These instinctive behaviors — thought, experiment or action, observation, repetition — are actually the foundations of science.
Science is core to human development.
Its principles — autonomy, freedom, improvement, revelation, sharing, imagination, creativity — are hidden in plain sight in daily living, most evident in children.
But these human principles, loosely coupled in the natural discovery of play, can be drawn out into a formal system for thinking about the universe and the way it works.
The scientific method is a way by which we can ponder the rules that govern the universe, test those theories, gather evidence of how successful our theories are, and refine them as we learn along the way.

Science is organized play.
