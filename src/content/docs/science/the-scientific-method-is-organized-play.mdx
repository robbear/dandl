Child’s play is natural and untaught.
Children experiment, dropping things, observing balls bounce, learning to throw and apply forces to objects, playing with mud and seeing how water interacts with different materials.
These attributes of play are instinctive — thought, experiment, observation, repetition.
They are also the foundations of science.

The way children learn through play is a model for understanding the scientific method.

The scientific method is a way to ponder the rules that govern the universe, test those theories, gather evidence of how well those theories work, and refine them while learning along the way.
Much like play, the scientific method is meant to capture human creativity and imagination, but it provides a framework of discovery more formal than play.

Here is one way of visualizing that more formal framework of discovery through play.

**Imagine → Predict → Try → Watch → Compare → Adjust → Share**

1. **Imagine**  
   Become curious and wonder *“What if…?”* or *“Why does that happen?”*

2. **Predict**  
   Make a guess about what might happen — like setting rules for a game.

3. **Try it Out**  
   Experiment by testing the idea in action.

4. **Watch Closely**  
   Observe what actually happens during the experiment.

5. **Compare**  
   Ask whether the results matched the prediction.

6. **Adjust the Idea**  
   Revise the idea based on what was learned, and try again if needed.

7. **Share the Discovery**  
   Tell others what was found so they can learn from it too.

One of the benefits of having a formal framework is having a means for sharing the process of discovery with others.
Just as in inventing a new game, the game cannot be shared and played with others unless the rules of the game can be communicated.
In the same way, the scientific method provides a way to share discoveries so that others can follow directions for performing the experiments, validating the results, and building upon the knowledge gained.

The refinements in the practice of the scientific method are similar to how expertise grows in play and sports.
As children learn to play football, they may initially all chase the ball around the pitch, but later they learn to cooperate and spread strategically about as they pass the ball to each other.
The rules of the game have not changed, but their sophistication in playing the game has increased.
So, too, with the practice of the scientific method, the refinement and improvement of experimental processes and practice over time lead to deeper understanding and more reliable results.

Both play and science are driven by the same roots of human behavior — autonomy, freedom, improvement, revelation, sharing, imagination, and creativity. 

Science is organized play.
