title: The Scientific Method Is Purely Human
description: How we discover the way the world works.

Science brings to mind the topics of chemistry, biology, or physics.
Through traditional schooling, categorized learning has organized the body of scientific knowledge into these familiar subjects.
But people often forget that they learned science in a much more instinctive way long before they began school.

As developing toddlers, children are natural scientists, exploring their world.
They experiment.
They drop things and observe that balls bounce.
Crumpled paper does not.
A flat sheet of paper floats.
Balls roll when pushed and eventually stop.
Glasses break when dropped.

As children grow, they watch and learn from each other and from adults.
They combine their understanding of falling objects with their experience of applying force when throwing balls.
While they may instinctively feel they need to add loft to give distance to their throw, they are building on a fundamental understanding of the relationship between forces and motion.
In a sense, they are building an internal library of data — a stored body of remembered sensations and experiences that they draw on for future actions.
They observe others and learn from their techniques.

These instinctive behaviors — thought, experiment or action, observation, repetition — are the foundations of science.
Science is core to human development.
Its principles — autonomy, freedom, improvement, revelation, sharing, imagination, creativity — are hidden in plain sight in daily living, yet they can be drawn out into a formal system for thinking about the universe and the way it works.
