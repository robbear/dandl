description: The Golden Rule and Constitutional Law.
---

The Golden Rule seems at first glance too simplistic a platitude to be applicable for interpreting constitutional law. As precedence builds up over time and interpretation fragments over the Framers' intent versus a living Constitutional view, it's easy to get into the weeds over legal debate.

At times, The Golden Rule can come to the rescue. When the law is being manipulated at its word rather than its intent in order to increase the power of one group over another, it's wisdom for a ruling Supreme Court to consider the consequences of its decision should the political balance of that court or of the other Branches be reversed in the future. This seems obvious, but the temptations of immediate political reward are very powerful, and the notion that changes in political fortune occur over time often seem beyond the imagination of the actors of the day.

The Golden Rule as a foundation for ethical behavior seems *mathematically unassailable* but too easily ignored, to the peril of political stability.
