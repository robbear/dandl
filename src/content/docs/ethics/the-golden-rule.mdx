description: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Treat other people the way you want other people to treat you.

Can we agree on a basic principle of decency, an axiom of ethics upon which to build rules for governing and discovering truth? If we consider how we want to be treated, we can  consider that as a basis for how we treat others.

But perhaps we can [do even better](/ethics/the-platinum-rule).
