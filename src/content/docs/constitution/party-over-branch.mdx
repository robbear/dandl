[Oath of Office](/constitution/oath-of-office)

Historically, this is wishful thinking going back all the way to the founding fathers. In George Washington's administration, Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State was a vigorous rival to Alexandar Hamilton who served as the Treasury Secretary. Hamilton's advocacy of a strong central federal government through financial and other policies was opposed by Jefferson and others, resulting in a fracture between two parties known as the Federalists, represented by Hamilton and Washington's policies, and Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, and others who favored a decentralized government represented by a strong legislative branch.

Jefferson was notorious for serving in the Executive Branch, but quietly undermining Washington and his bitter rival, Hamilton, by conspiring with his political allies in the Legislative Branch. Jefferson considered Washington's Proclamation of Neutrality to be intruding on congressional duties of declaring war and, implicitly, neutrality, and instead of defending the Executive Branch's perogative, worked politically with his congressional allies to attack Washington and weaken the Executive Branch under which he served.
