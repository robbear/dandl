The U.S. Constitution was drafted over the course of roughly four months in 1787 and was the written primarily by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay.  It was signed on September 17, 1787, by 39 of the 55 delegates present at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. George Washington served as the president of the convention.

The Constitution established the framework for the federal government of the United States, replacing the Articles of Confederation, binding the original thirteen independent states into a single nation. It created three branches of government designed to provide checks and balances on each other: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch.
