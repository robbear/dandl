description: Context and background on the U.S. Constitution.
---

The U.S. Constitution was drafted over the course of roughly four months in 1787 and was written primarily by **James Madison**, **Alexander Hamilton**, and **John Jay**.
It was signed on September 17, 1787, by 39 of the 55 delegates present at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.
**George Washington** served as president of the convention.

The Constitution established the framework for the federal government of the United States, replacing the Articles of Confederation and binding the original thirteen independent states into a single nation.
It created three branches of government designed to provide checks and balances on each other: the [legislative branch](/constitution/legislative-branch), the [executive branch](/constitution/executive-branch), and the [judicial branch](/constitution/judicial-branch).

## Structure

The Constitution consists of a preamble, seven articles, and twenty-seven amendments.

### Preamble

The preamble is notable for its eloquence.
It was written by **Gouverneur Morris**, who was known for his elegant writing style.

> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

### Articles

The first three articles of the Constitution define the three branches of government.
**Article I** describes the duties of the legislative branch, or Congress.
**Article II** defines the executive branch and the presidency.
**Article III** details the role of the judicial branch.

Since the design of the Constitution constructs a system of government in which the branches are coequal and provide checks and balances on each other’s powers, it might seem at first that three articles would suffice.
So what purpose do the other four articles serve?

**Article IV** establishes the relationship between the states and the national government, outlining how states must interact with one another and guaranteeing a republican form of government across all states.

**Article V** explains how the Constitution can be amended.
That the Constitution is a living, evolving document is one of the brilliant foresights of its founders.

**Article VI** establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the nation.
It also prohibits religious tests for public office and ensures that the United States assumes responsibility for all debts incurred prior to the signing of the Constitution — an important statement about national fiscal stability.

Finally, **Article VII** established the process by which the Constitution was to be ratified by the thirteen states.

### Amendments

The first ten amendments to the Constitution, known collectively as the **Bill of Rights**, were ratified in 1791.
The Bill of Rights guaranteed personal freedoms, and their passage was considered necessary to garner the support of Anti-Federalists — those opposed to the new Constitution who supported the older, decentralized Articles of Confederation and feared an overly powerful federal government.
