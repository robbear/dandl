title: Oath of Office
description: The oath taken by U.S. federal government officials.
---

> *The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.*

**U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 3**

If you think of the Constitution as a set of rules designed to keep any one branch of government from dominating the others, or any individual from grabbing undo power, then as long as all those participating in the government follow the rules of the Constitution, democracy and the rule of law will prevail. The power of the Constitution lies in its ideals and in the purity of its enactment, in the willingness in its participants to uphold its rules.

Since the Executive branch is powerfully represented by a single individual, the Constitution makes a point of explicitly specifying the oath of office for the President of the United States:

**Article II, Section 1, Clause 8:**

> *Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:â€“ I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.*

## Why The Oath Is Important

The Constitution is nothing more than a document, an agreement. It doesn't have an army. There is no outside authority enforcing its rules. The only enforcement comes from those willing citizen participants who agree to abide by its rules and see in it a means for peacefully, effectively, and democratically governing themselves. The oath that office holders take is a solemn promise demonstrating an understanding of how fragile the Constitutional framework is. It is entirely dependent on their willingness to support and defend its rules and intent. If they and their colleagues treat their oath as empty words, there is no one else to implement the rules of law.

The oath they take requires a deep understanding of the meaning of the Constitution, not just a recitation of the words of the oath. The Constitution lays out a mechanism by which three branches of government serve as protections and balances against the other branches. In a sense, when an office holder takes their oath of office, they are making a pledge to serve the role of their branch of government. If they are to support and defend the Constitution. what else can that mean but to perform their role of government under the terms of the Constitution?

Let's think about that a little deeper. Support and defend the Constitution doesn't mean form a ring around it at the Smithsonian or wherever copies of it are guarded on display. It means to make sure its rules are enacted, that the rule of law is supported. Since the core of the Constition's design is the, let's call it, cooperative struggle, between the three branches of government, then an office holder is truly taking an oath to perform their constitutional branch role per the terms of the Constitution.

The Constitution says nothing about political parties or politics in general. Instead, the Constitution is designed to constrain the behavior of political means such that ends are arrived at lawfully. So by oath, an office holder's first duty is to the role of their branch of government, not to the goals of their political party. For example, if a president is breaking the law, it should be the responsibility of a legislator of the same political party to constrain those illegal acts by virtue of the legislator's Constitutional oath which comes before their political party's goals.

By swearing the oath of office, an office holder is making a promise to keep this priority straight. This is why the oath of office is so important. What we become dependent on, then, are cultural norms that determine whether personal honor and integrity are valued more than political power and party loyalty.
