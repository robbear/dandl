description: The constitutional role of the Executive Branch of the U.S. government.

Article II of the Constitution describes the role of the Executive Branch of the United States government, “vested in a President of the United States of America.” The second article is remarkably brief, outlining how the President and Vice President are to be elected, the President’s role as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, and the power to enter into treaties, appoint ambassadors, judges, and other officers. It also provides instructions for how the Legislative Branch may remove the President from office through impeachment and conviction.

Given the brevity of Article II, it is remarkable how powerful the office of the presidency has become over time. Much of this growth can be attributed to **George Washington**’s role as the first President and the influence of his Cabinet—especially Treasury Secretary **Alexander Hamilton**, a strong advocate for an energetic central government led by a vigorous executive. Hamilton believed the Executive Branch should guide foreign policy and, through the Treasury Department, shape fiscal policy via a central bank and a unified national currency. Washington shared these views, and together they set important national precedents during the Republic’s formative years following ratification of the Constitution.

## Checks and Balances

The Constitution grants the Executive Branch power over the Legislative Branch through the use of the veto and the ability to propose legislation. The President can also call Congress into special session. With regard to the Judicial Branch, the President appoints judges and, through the use of the presidential pardon, can effectively override judicial decisions affecting individuals.
