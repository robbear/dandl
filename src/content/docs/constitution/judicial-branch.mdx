title: The Judicial Branch
description: The constitutional role of the judicial branch of the U.S. government.
---

Article III of the Constitution defines the role of the judicial branch of the United States government.
It begins by declaring the existence of a single Supreme Court and assigns to the legislative branch the power to establish and organize lower federal courts.
Article III also defines the jurisdiction of both the lower courts and the Supreme Court, including when cases may be brought directly before the Supreme Court.
The federal judicial system was established to resolve legal questions that fall outside the jurisdiction of individual states — such as disputes between multiple states, cases involving states and individuals residing in other states, and matters concerning federal laws and treaties.

Article III further establishes judicial independence from the executive and legislative branches by ensuring lifetime tenure for federal judges, revocable only through impeachment and conviction.
It also protects justices from reductions in pay as retaliation for unpopular or politically inconvenient decisions.

## Judicial Review — *Marbury v. Madison*

In 1803, during the early years of the Republic, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice **John Marshall** struck down an act of Congress as unconstitutional.
This ruling established the precedent that the judicial branch holds the power to review the actions of the other two branches of government and serve as a barrier against unconstitutional overreach.
Marshall’s decision imposed a critical judicial check on both the legislative and executive branches, firmly establishing the Supreme Court as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.
*Marbury v. Madison* became a landmark decision that helped prevent constitutional crises from overwhelming the young nation’s political evolution.
