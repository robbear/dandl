## Thoughts on how to live and learn

Does might make right? How do we decide who is the authoritative source of knowledge, truth, and power?

The way we choose the system by which to govern ourselves is similar to how we discover the way the world works.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="The Golden Rule">
    [Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.](/ethics/the-golden-rule/)

    Can we agree on a basic principle of decency, an axiom of ethics upon which to build rules for governing and discovering truth?
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Scientific Method">
    [How we discover the way the world works.](/science/the-scientific-method/)

    Is it possible to iteratively approach understanding of our universe through overservation, experimentation, and sharing information, without appeal to or reliance on authority? How do our methods of discovery relate to our methods of ethics and governance?
  </Card>
  <Card title="U.S. Constitution">
    [Context and background on the U.S. Constitution.](/constitution/historical-notes/)

    The United States Constitution is a document of elegance and reason, designed to provide checks and balances on governing power. The Constitution didn't appear out of nowhere, but was the product of real people, whose talent, insights, inspiration, and determination met the moment to shape a new nation and set an example for the world.

    How are the principles of decency and discovery reflected in our system of governance?

## Why this site?

We can follow a braid of learning when we consider how ethics, the methods of discovery through scientific inquiry, and governance through democratic constitutional principles intertwine. This site holds a collection of thoughts and ideas inspired by this braid, where the inspiration is to live and learn with decency, integrity, and continuous self-improvement.
